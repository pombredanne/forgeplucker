The ForgePlucker project aims to produce a robot that can extract a
project's state from a hosting site sourch as SourceForge, Berlios, or
Savane.  

The use cases for such a tool, and future possibilities springing from
it, are described in the ForgePlucker project plan: look in
"docs/forgeplucker-plan.txt".

The code is in early development; see the manual page for limitations.
We are actively seeking contributers who want to own the job of maintaining 
ForgePlucker classes for particular forge systems.
