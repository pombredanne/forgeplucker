The ForgePlucker project aims to produce a robot that can extract a
project's state from a hosting site such as SourceForge, Berlios, or
Savane, or from installations of FusionForge for instance.

The use cases for such a tool, and future possibilities springing from
it, are described in the ForgePlucker project plan: look in
"docs/forgeplucker-plan.txt".

The code is in early development; see the manual page for limitations.
We are actively seeking contributers who want to own the job of maintaining 
ForgePlucker classes for particular forge systems.

New BSD license applies.  See the file COPYING for license terms.

You may try to use regress-driver to test non-regression on test forge
projects (see --help for options). The tests/ dir contains .chk files
used by regress-driver, and corresponding to the output of bugplucker
for these projects.

The bugplucker script will connect to a forge project and extract some
of its contents to the JSON format(s) supported by forgeplucker. See
--help for details of options.
