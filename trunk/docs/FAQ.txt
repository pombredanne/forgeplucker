== ForgePlucker Frequently Asked Questions ==

ForgePlucker is a young project to have a FAQ, but some
questions came up repeatedly during early design discussions
around the project launch.

=== What do you mean by "project state", anyway? ===

We aim to recover everything needed to get a project up and running on
another forge site. Source-code repositories, bug tracker state,
webspace and wikis, mailing lists, the whole thing.

=== Why web-scrape rather than trying to build exporters into existing forges? ===

The architectures of most forge systems would be very difficult to
modify to support native exporters: see
file:jail-breaking-the-forges.html[this discussion]. Even if they
weren't, developing and deploying to each and every forge site out
there would be way too much like work. Most hosting sites are run on a
shoestring budget by dedicated but overworked administrators who are
unlikely to be receptive to potentially disruptive upgrades with
obvious security risks attached. We'd welcome their cooperation, but
by writing ForgePlucker we avoid being critically dependent on it.

=== How do you expect to do reliable capture through web interfaces, aren't they chronically unstable? ===

They're not as unstable as you might think. One of the consequences of
the bad architectural decisions most forges have inherited is that
interfaces are tightly coupled to implementation; accordingly, forge
interfaces tend to change slowly when they change at all.

=== How do you recover good data from HTML that's presentation-centered? ===

Forgeplucker plays various tricks to ignore presentation level and cut
through to structure.  An important one is relying heavily on the 
structure of generated HTML select menus, which are easy to parse out
of the surrounding tag soup and carry not just the existing values of
important metadata but much of the information about what values
they can have.

=== OK, but doesn't that sort of thing have to be messy and huge and hard to maintain? ===

You'd be surprised. The initial proof-of-concept, which pulled
bugtracker state out of Berlios, was less than 500 lines of Python.
More than half of that moved to our GenericForge class and is shared
among types.  The Berlios and Savane handler classes were about
200 and less than 100 lines each when we first published; we estimate
that a full ForgePlucker implementation will cost not more than about
400 lines of Python per site type.

=== Your dump format varies by site type. Shouldn't you have designed a standardized representation first? ===

We think it's smarter to get 100% state capture from a wide variety of
forge types first, then use the domain knowledge we gain to design a
format that will really work.

=== I'm a forge-system maintainer, and I don't want my system to be a jail. How can I cooperate? ===

First: put a meta tag on your generated main page with type and
version attributes identifying your forge software, so our bot will
know what it's dealing with. Second: Provide a per-project URL that
returns a machine-parseable report on as much of the state as you can
conveniently dump.  It doesn't have to be our format, as long as it's
unambiguous and version-stamped and relatively easy to parse (XML or
JSON are good bases).  You give us the spec, we'll write the parser.
For other things you can do, ask on our dev list.

=== I'm a random hacker and this project looks interesting.  What kind of help do you need? ===

The main thing we need is developers who care a lot about individual
forge types and are motivated to keep their handler classes
complete and up to date.  We don't expect this to be a large job after
the initial implementation is done (the first handler class took
four days, the second about two), but it does mean being ready to
respond quickly on the (probably rare) occasions when something
breaks.

===  Is ForgePlucker a stepping stone to something else, like writing a new forge system? ===

Obviously, the usefulness of project-state export is limited if there
aren't any automatic importers.  But there are several ways the future
might play out.  In one, existing forges cheer us on and make the
effort required to implement importers for our interchange format;
everybody wins.  In another, our devs eventually write a new forge
system that can import from anywhere, and that pressures other forge
designers into writing importers. In a third, existing forges are too
technically and/or politically broken to write importers, so we write a
forge and it takes over the world.  We don't care which of those
happens.  Yet.
