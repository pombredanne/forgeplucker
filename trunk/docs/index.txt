= ForgePlucker -- Freeing Open-Source Projects from Data Jail =

The ForgePlucker project aims to produce tools to capture and back up
project state from commonly used forge systems (open-source hosting
sites). Bad architectural decisions in early forge systems have made
their descendants into (unintentional) data jails; ForgePlucker
will break our projects free.

== Project Home and Communications ==

The project is hosted at https://gna.org/projects/forgeplucker/[Gna!];
to participate, you will need a https://gna.org/[Gna! signon] and a
Subversion client.

We have an IRC channel, '#forgeplucker' on Freenode.
Developers and interested parties are encouraged to watch it.

There is a project mailing list, https://mail.gna.org/listinfo/forgeplucker-dev/[forgeplucker-dev@gna.org].

You can track the project's history on its https://www.ohloh.net/p/foregeplucker[Ohloh page].

== How You Can Help ==

We are actively seeking interested developers.  Ideally, each forge
type should have an owner-advocate who takes the lead in ensuring that
ForgePlucker's handler module for that forge is complete and up
to date. The http:FAQ.html[FAQ] should address your questions about the 
time and effort required.

We welcome cooperation from forge designers interested in better 
export/import tools for their systems. We intend to make that job easier by
defining and maintaining a standard interchange format so you don't
have to.
