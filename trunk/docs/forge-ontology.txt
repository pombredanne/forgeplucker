== Scope of this document ==

Forges are software-project hosting systems.  In order to support
cross-forge migration of projects, a common representation and
ontology of project states will be required.  This document
informally constructs such an antology and describes how the
representations of different forge systems map to it.

The ontology described here is not yet complete.  It is being
developed in conjunction with forgeplucker, which is as
yet only capable of extracting tracker state from forges.  

To motivate this, it is worth bearing in mind the forgeplucker goal: 
extraction of a complete enough sate that it could in principle
be uploaded into another forge site and create a running project.

== CFO, the Common Forge Ontology ==

Ontology terms are in all caps.  Terms suffixed with ? 
are placeholders intended for further development. Comma-separated
lists enclosed in [] are controlled vocabularies.

=== IDENTITY objects ===

An IDENTITY object identifies a person. An IDENTITY has the following
parts:

NICK:: Nickname of a developer, usurally the person part of an email address  
EMAIL:: String that is the fully qualified email address of a person
NAME:: String that is the name of a person.

The NICK may be the special value None representing an anonymous or
unspecified user, in which case the NAME and EMAIL parts are not used.

=== PULL-INTERVAL OBJECTS ===

A PULL-INTERVAL object represents the time interval associated with
the capture of project state or some portion of it.  The capture
is guaranteed to contain all changes prior to the capture start date, and
no changes after the capture end date.

A PULL-INTERVAL has the following parts:

- CAPTURE-START:: Timestamp, when the caprure of the parent object began
- CAPTURE-END:: Timestamp, when the capture of the parent object completed

=== RELEASE objects and subobjects ===

A RELEASE is product files and metadata describing a software release.  It
has the foilowing parts:

- ID:: A string naming the release
- DATE:: Date of the release
- DESCRIPTION:: Text of release notes
- PRODUCT_LIST:: One or more PRODUCT objects

A PRODUCT is a shippable form of a release, or release component.
Possible PRODUCTs include source tarballs, RPMs, Debian packages, or
SHA1 checksum files.  PRODUCT objects have the following parts:

- FILENAME:: Product filename
- DESCRIPTION:: Optional one-line description
- MIMETYPE:: MIME type
- ARCHITECTURE:: Tag for the product's target architecture 
- TYPE:: Controlled vocabulary describing the project resource type

=== PROJECT-STATE OBJECTS ===

A PROJECT-STATE object is intended to capture the entire state of
a project for export and re-import.

A PROJECT-STATE has the following parts:

SHORTNAME:: a project identification string that is a legal Unix path segment.
LONGNAME:: a name for human use.
DESCRIPTION:: a text description of the project.
PRIVILEGE-LIST:: List of PRIVILEGE objects with the following parts.
- IDENTITY:: Identity of a project number; may not be Anonymous
- CAPABILITY-LIST:: Zero or more CAPABILITY tokens.
- TITLE:: String describing the member's project role 
SUBSYSTEM-LIST:: One or more SUBSYSTEM parts, which may be one of the following:
- REPOSITORY with the following parts.
* NAME:: a string identifying the repository.
* TYPE:: a string identifying the version control system.
* CONTENT:: a file or directory.
- LISTS:: Zero or more MAILING-LIST? objects
- WEBSPACE:: a directory.
- RELEASE-LIST:: Zero or more RELEASE objects.
- TRACKER:: Refer to the TRACKER definition below.
- CAPTURED:: A PULL-INTERVAL for the project state capture.

Most forges limit projects to one REPOSITORY and one WEBSPACE.
This ontology supports more than one repository because that may
be useful for modeling repo conversions.

A CAPABILITY consists of any of the following:

- ADMINISTRATOR:: can modify capabilities (boolean)
- TRUSTED:: can examine tracker items marked private (boolean)
- A TRACKER-PERMISSION::
* ID:: The ID of the tracker
* TECHNICIAN:: can the user be assigned artifacts from here (boolean, optional) 
* MANAGER:: can the user modify artifacts on here (boolean, optional) 

=== TRACKER objects and subobjects ===

A TRACKER object is intended to contain the entire state of one of a
project's issue trackers.  It has several subobject types.  All but
ARTIFACT, the central and most complex one, are described here.  ARTIFACT
is described in the next section.

In the descriptions below, a 'nick' is the site-local username of a
project developer.

A TRACKER has the following parts:

TYPE:: One of [Bugs, Features, Support, Patches, Tasks].
CAPTURED:: A PULL-INTERVAL for the tracker capture.
ARTIFACT-LIST:: One or more ARTIFACT objects.  Refer to the ARTIFACT 
                definition below
RANGES:: A map from ARTIFACT slots to lists of possible string values
SUBSCRIBERS:: List of SUBSCRIBER objects describing persons to be
              notified when an artifact is added to the tracker.

A COMMENT has the collowing parts:

SUBMITTER:: IDENTITY, the submitting user.
DATE:: A timestamp.
TEXT:: Comment text.

A FIELDCHANGE has the following parts

BY:: Nick of developer making a change to field value (not an IDENTITY)
DATE:: A timestamp.
FIELD:: An ARTIFACT fieldname
OLD:: The value before the change
NEW:: The value after the change

An ATTACHMENT has the following parts

URL:: Where the file can be fetched
FILENAME:: A string, the name of the file as attached (optional)
DATE:: Date of attachment (optional)
ID:: A string that is a file attachment ID, conventionally numeric
BY:: IDENTITY
DESCRIPTION:: One-line description of file contents (optional)

A SUBSCRIBER has the following parts:

CC-TO:: Email address
COMMENT:: Why this person is subscribed

=== ARTIFACT objects ===

The ARTIFACT object is the most complex and variable one in the entuire
ontology.  It is described by several tables.

The Internal Fieldname table maps slots into the ontology to the form
attributes used on different forge system.  The 'Savane' column
describes both Savane and Savane-Cleanup.  A '-' value means the slot
is unsupported on that system. If the entry is 'Unnamed', the
attribute is supported but not editable in the artifact detail form, and
must be scraped from presentation-level HTML rather than parsing
INPUT elements.  Otherwise the entry names the form parameter that
names this slot.

Under Savane, slots with starred field names can be defined in one of
two ways: as a free-text field. or as a select box with an
administrator-defined controlled vocabulary.  In the latter case, the
fieldmame gets an '_id' suffix.

The 'Intended Semantics' table describes the intended semantics of each slot.

Pending is a non-closed status in which development work is considered done,
but some other work is needed (QA, documentation, etc.) The ideal workflow is
Open -> Pending -> Closed. Of course, the real workflow is up to the
developers.

== Additional metadata not covered by the ontology ==

Under Berlios, SourceForge, and Savane, every tracker has a list of
canned responses associated with it,

Berlios, SourceForge, and Savane all have a notion of "squads"
(permission groups) which we don't capture.

SourceForge trackers have a set of preferences that should probably be
considered part of project state.

- Whether or not to allow posting by anonymous users
- Whether or not closed artifacts should be reopened when submitter
  attaches a new coment.
- Timeouts associated with overdue and Pending status on SourceForge.
- Canned texts to be shown on the artifact submission and tracker 
  browse pages.
- Hidden vs. visible preferences for all metadata other than ID and Summary.

Savane has Cookbook and News features we don't capture.

Under Savane, every modifiable ARTIFACT field has some additional
attributes:

- Whether it is optional, mandatory, or mandatory only if it was
  presented to the submitter.
- Who it is visible to (Project members, logged-in users, anonymous users)
- Screen rank
- Whether or not artifact changes are stored in the HISTORY list.

Under Savane, it is also possible to selectively allow or disallow
various transitions in enumerated and controlled values.

Savane also allows the definition of up to 10 each of custom text
areas and select boxes, and up to 5 customizable date fields.  These
have fieldnames of the form *_custom. 

== Incompatibilities ==

Berlios and SourceForge lack many artifact fields found Savane and
SavaneCleanup.

The RESOLUTION slot is screen-labeled "Resolution" on Berlios, but
"Status" on Savane.  The STATUS slot is labeled "Status:" on
Berlios, but "Open/Closed" on Savane.

The Berlios PATCH field could be imported to other systems as an
ATTACHMENT object.

Berlios and SourceForge have separate bug and feature trackers.
Savane has no separate feature tracker; projects separate those by
using the Bug Category or Bug Group field.

Under SourceForge, there is no predefined Task tracker, but it is
possible to create custom trackers that don't fit one of the named
types.

Savane ATTACHMENT objects lack the DESCRIPTION slot,  SourceForge
ATTACHMENT objects lack MIMETYPE.

Berlios and SourceForge allow setting (in tracker preferences) the
address of a commit list for new submissions, and its subscriptions
have no explanation attached.  Savane allows setting a CC list for
notification on all state changes, and each subscription can have an
explanatory comment.  The CFO SUBSCRIBER slot assumes Savane-like
behavior which Berlios and SourceForge cannot support.

== Open Questions ==

We need a definition of MAILING-LIST.

What are the controlled vocabularies for PRODUCT::TYPE,
PRODUCT::ARCHITECTURE?

There are other kinds of objects that might be considered part of
a project state: blogs, wikis, and forums leap to mind.  Which of
these should we try to capture?

How much of the state described under "Additional metadata" should
be brought into CFO?  Is there a principled distinction between "state
of the project" and "state of the forge"?

== Formalizing the ontology ==

The PROJECT class is a pretty close match to DOAP.  We'll
need an extension field cfo#captured.

The IDENTITY class can be represented by FOAF.

== Appendix: Forge permissions models ==

These permissions models are documented here because CFO will have to
capture at least some portions of them.  But that has not yet been done.

=== Berlios ===

Each project member may be assigned a role.  The role set is as follows:

- Undefined
- Developer
- Project Manager
- Unix Admin', u'Doc Writer
- Tester
- Support Manager
- Graphic/Other Designer
- Doc Translator
- Editorial/Content Writer
- Packager (.rpm, .deb etc)
- Analysis / Design
- Advisor/Mentor/Consultant
- Distributor/Promoter
- Content Management
- Requirements Engineering
- Web Designer
- Porter (Cross Platform Devel.)

Each developer has two general permissions:

Administrator:: May edit project member permissions
Release Technician:: May create project releases

There are five trackers: bugs, tasks, support, patches, and features.  For each
tracker, a member may have either or both of the following privilege
bits:

- Technician - may be assigned issues on this tracker
- Administrator - may modify issues on this tracker

There are two other flags per member:

- The user may be enabled as a forum moderator
- The user may be enabled as a document-manager editor

Mailing lists have separate permissions and passwords, 
being managed through Mailman.

=== Savane ===

There are no named developer roles as on Berlios.

Each developer has two general permissions:

Administrator:: May edit project member permissions
Trusted User:: May view private bugs (the interface does not use "Trusted")

There are four trackers: bugs, tasks, patches, and support.  There are
two special features: the cookbook mamnager and the news manager.  For
each feature, a member may have either or both of the following privilege
bits:

- Technician - may be assigned items on this feature
- Manager - may modify items on this tracker (like Berlios Administrator)

Mailing lists have separate permissions and passwords, 
being managed through Mailman.
