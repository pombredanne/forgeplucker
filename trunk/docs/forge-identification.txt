= The Forge-Identification Meta Header =

Version 1.0

The Forge-Identification meta header is intended to identify the
software type of a forge (a software-project hosting site) in a 
simple machine-parseable way.  The purpose of this identification
is to allow robots interacting with forges to dispatch to different
logic paths depending on the forge type.

== Where This Header Should Be Emitted ==

This header should be emitted in the head section of every page
generated by forge software, including but not limited to: site entry
pages, tracker index pages, and tracker item detail pages.

== Form of the Header ==

The form of the header is as follows:

<meta name="Forge-Identification" content="NAME\:VERSION[\:OPTIONS]">

(The slashes in the above are an ASCIIDOC markup glitch.  Ignore them.)

where NAME is replaced by the name of the forge suite, VERSION
by its version level, and OPTIONS by a comma-separated list of
tokens describing administrative options in effect at the site. 

Potential value of the NAME Field include, e.g., "SourceForge",
"FusionForge", "Savane", or "SavaneCleanup".  Future versions of this
document will list names known to be in use.

The VERSION field identifies the release level of the forge suite, It
is recommended that the version be in an A.B or A.B.C format; that is a
major version should be separated from a minor version by a period,
which may be followed by a nother period and a release level.  The
intended semantics is for major version bumps to mark incompatible
changes.

The OPTIONS section is optional. If present, it will consist of a
comma-separated sequence of tokens in a controlled vocabulary
describing administrative options which may change the 
expected behavior at this site.  No elements of this vocabulary
are yet defined.

== Processing Rules ==

None of these fields may contain the colon character. If there
is need, a future revision of this document will define an
escape syntax.  

Code that parses this header should not treat the presence of
more than the expected number of colon-separated content subfields 
fields as an error, but simply discard those it does not know how to
parse.  Future extensions may define additional fields.
