<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>In early October 2009, before starting ForgePlucker, I seriously
considered writing a new forge system from
scratch. <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=1302">Sanity prevailed</a>, but the
design speculations I wrote down may sttill be interesting to people
other than me &#8212; if only because some of these ideas are relevant to
the more restricted scope of ForgePlucker.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Some pieces of this may migrate to the ForgePlucker project plan as
that design gets fleshed out.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="_the_state_of_forges">The State of Forges</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>For the purposes of this discussion, we define the "state" associated
with a given project as all data and metadata pertaining to it on the
hosting system.  Project state includes but is not limited to the
following:</p></div>
<div class="olist"><ol>
<li>
<p>
Contents of version-control repositories
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The content and structure of webspace and wikis owned by the project.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Contents of the project bug tracker, and of any other auxiliary
   trackers such as patch and task trackers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Developer lists and role assignments.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Project releases, including product files and release metadata.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mailing list state (address lists, options, and archives).
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="para"><p>To solve these problems in full generality, a hosting system would
require three major capabilities.</p></div>
<div class="olist"><ol>
<li>
<p>
The ability to export all project state, or selected portions of
   it, into lossless static representations - state dumps - that can
   be archived.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The ability to re-import a state dump to re-create a project.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The ability to import partial state dumps and apply them as edits
   to the live project state.  This requirement intentionally implies
   the ability to script transactions that change the state.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_high_level_design_strategy">High-level Design Strategy</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>I propose to address this problem by writing a server daemon which
I will call "Savant". Savant will be a primarily a request broker
for the hosting system's database, but will also have the capability
to query the state of detached subsystems such as a MailMan instance.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The server daemon's job will be to accept two kinds of messages:
requests to dump some portion of the hosting system's state, and
requests to add to or modify the state.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>It is expected that the daemon will be connected to an email responder
robot so that queries and edit requests can be mailed to it, in which
case it will return state dumps and acknowledgements or error
notifications by mail.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>It is also expected that the daemon will be connected to a well-known
Internet port so that client programs can converse with it
directly. Once Savant is in production, it may become convenient for
the hosting system's own Web front end to operate in this way.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>In order for this daemon to be useful, it must implement an
application protocol or domain-specific minilanguage in which the
high-level objects of the hosting system ("project", "bug tracker",
"mailing list", and the like) are accessible as first-class objects
that can be inspected and modified.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The principal design challenge of Savant is to pick the correct set of
objects and relationships, then find a way to expose those objects and
relationships through a representation with good behavior.  "Good
behavior" means, specifically, this:</p></div>
<div class="olist"><ol>
<li>
<p>
The representation must be lossless and <strong>invertible</strong>.  That is,
it must be possible for Savant to read in a representation and
accurately reproduce the state from which it was dumped.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The representation must be <strong>transparent</strong>. That is, a human being
should be able to read it, understand the object state, and edit
the representation without undue difficulty.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The representation must have <strong>minimal novelty</strong> and obey the KISS
principle. It should exploit Unicode, ISO 8601, XML, JSON, RFC-822,
and other standards as thoroughly as possible in order to make
learning it and writing clients as easy as possible.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_some_building_blocks_and_terminology">Some Building Blocks and Terminology</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<h3 id="_meta_protocols">Meta-protocols</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>One way to achieve KISS is to build the Savant application protocol on top
of an existing meta-protocol or set of meta-protocols. Never having
to write a custom parser is a good thing.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>My first design choice is to make the Savant protocol an application
of JSON wrapped in an RFC-822/MIME envelope.</p></div>
<h3 id="_why_json">Why JSON?</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>Why JSON, rather than, for example, XML?  Three reasons:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>First: I think JSON is well-suited to the shape of the objects we will
be manipulating, which will consist largely of lots of containers full
of (a) attribute/value pairs, (b) smaller containers, and (c) pieces
of text that aren't very large. The exceptions, such as repositories,
will be extremely large blob-like objects that we wouldn't want
to carry in-line of any protocol, whether JSON or XML or anything
else.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Second: I have recent successful experience of building a JSON-baed
application protocol for GPSD.  I was extremely impressed with how
lightweight this format and the tools for it are.  At one point I was
able to write a fairly complete JSON parser in 300 lines of C, and I
have made effective use of the JSON module in Python.  The contrast
with the complex gymnastics required when using XML is quite striking.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Third: JSON, unlike XML, has an appealingly rich type ontology. As a
representation, it is essentially equivalent to Python or Perl data
structures without executable parts.  I didn't get a lot of advantage
from this in GPSD, which is written in C for legacy reasons.  But I
expect to write Savant in a modern language (probably Python). This
means the barrier between "outside" (the Savant protocol
representation) and "inside" (the data structures used within Savant)
can be low, with little or no glue code required.</p></div>
<h3 id="_why_rfc_822">Why RFC-822?</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>One of our interfaces to Savant is going to be an email autoresponder
bot.  Rather than strip off the RFC-822 wrapper before handing
the request to Savant, I think there are two excellent reasons to keep
it as an integral part of the protocol.  They are:</p></div>
<div class="olist"><ol>
<li>
<p>
Authentication. PGP signatures associated with email addresses is
as good as it gets for verifying that the author of a message is who
he or she claims to be.  This will be an issue in requests to modify
privileged state.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
MIME is a serviceable container for for multi-part objects consisting
of a message and one or more attachments.  In our case, we might need
a state dump to consist (a) of a few lines of JSON specifying a system
object, and (b) one or more large binary blobs that are the actual
content of some of the object fields.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="para"><p>We could work hard at developing our own functional equivalent of
RFC-822 with MIME attachments, but that would be pointless.  By
using it, we'll immediately get the ability to forget the protocol
details and re-use a lot of standard library code.</p></div>
<h4 id="_job_cards_folding_and_unfolding">Job cards, Folding, and Unfolding ===</h4>
<div class="para"><p>With these premises in place, we can define a central feature of
Savant: what its requests and responses will look at one level above
the wire protocol, to a human or program outside Savant and to the code
inside it.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Savant requests and responses will both be instances of Savant
messages.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>From the "inside" point of view of Savant, a message will be one big
object &#8212; a dictionary &#8212; with values that have the type ontology of
Python or Perl, that is numbers, strings, dictionaries, lists,
booleans, and None.  Importantly, the top level will have a "class"
attribute which will specify the object type.  (Types will include,
for example, "PROJECT", "TRACKER", and "MAILING-LIST".)</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>From the point of view of someone outside, a message will be an
RFC-822/MIME envelope containing a "job card" in JSON and zero or more
attachments for large blobs of data that are incorporated by reference
into the JSON structure.  This choice means a human, or a program, can
read the job card to get the semantics of the message and only look at
any blobs that might be attached when they become relevant.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>There will be two relatively simple operations at the interface
between Savant and client programs.  In one &#8212; folding &#8212; an internal
Savant object will be flattened into a an RFC-822/MIME representation.
Pieces of data above a threshold size will turn into attachments. The
rest of the structure will become a JSON text body.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>In the other &#8212; unfolding &#8212; various parts of a well-formed
RFC-822/MIME message including a JSON text body will be incorporated
into a structure.  References to attachments will be replaced with the
decoded attachment data.  The RFC-822 message sender will supply a
requesting identity if the JSON in the job card does not.  If the
message is PGP-signed, the unfolded structure will contain a boolean
expressing the authentication status.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_savant_objects">Savant Objects</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>With these levels of the design in place, we can now forget about the
lower-level details and consider what kinds of objects Savant has to
know about to do its job.  Furthemore, we can forget about the
technical distinction between the objects and their JSON representations
and start writing down transactions in JSON with reasonable confidence
that we will be able to implement what we describe.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The following description is in the spirit of what AI researchers call
an "ontology".  It is not presently complete.  It is intended to
explain the relationships among the most important objects in Savant's
universe.</p></div>

<div class="para"><p>Note the lookup rule.  We start at the top-level Host object. At each
step we look for an attribute of the object we're looking at; that
constrains the query for the next step.  The "projects" attribute
tells us to look in the projects dictionary for the value associated
with <em>wesnoth</em>, which will be a a Project object.  We then look for an
an attribute of the Wesnoth project object and find "trackers". That
navigates us into the Wesnoth trackers dictionary. We're out of
specifiers, so that object is the value of our query.</p></div>

<div class="para"><p>Some things to note here: the response is embedded in a "value"
attribute, with the query specifiers preserved. The object type of the
response is given by a "class" tag.  And some additional attributes,
providing an audit trail and not editable, have been set.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Here's an example of an error response. Assuming there is no user

<div class="para"><p>Observe that every subobject in this piece of JSON is a
self-describing unit with its own class tag.  This is quite
deliberate.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>There is a reason the queries written down so far have "get":"value"
in them.  Queries could be used to get and set other things as well:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Ask Savant for the list of keys in the Wesnoth project's trackers
dictionary:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">

       "value":["Bugs", "Tasks", "Patches"]}</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>As before, we first narrow the search space to Wesnoth.  But there are
no more specifiers that take us into subobjects. Instead, "attribute":
"trackers" says we want to look not at an individual tracker but at
the dictionary-valued tracker attribute. The "get:keys" query
would throw an error if this weren't a dictionary; since it is, it
returns the key set.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Ask Savant what the legal values for a bug category are in the Wesnoth
project:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>=&gt; {"get":"vocabulary", "projects":"wesnoth",

       "object":"Item", "attribute":"category",
       "value":["Bug", "Feature Request"]}</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>Instead, the "object" attribute says we want to look at Wesnoth's
local specialization of the Item object.  The "attribute" object then says
we're asking about its "category" member, The "get:vocabulary" query
would throw an error if this weren't a controlled-vocabulary field;
since it is, it returns the vocabulary list.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The point of these latter queries is so clients can check their
assumptions about legal values before setting them.  There will,
of course, be corresponding "set" queries.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_architecture_and_implementation_of_the_savant_daemon">Architecture and Implementation of the Savant daemon</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>The daemon will have three main components: a front end,
a language interpreter, and a back end.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The front end's job will be folding and unfolding messages. It
will accept incoming RFC-822/MIME/JSON and turn it into
internal structures corresponding to the JSON.  It will fiold
messages going in the other direction, moving blobs to
attachments.  It will check message authentication.  It will
track whether the request entered by email or the command port
and direct responses appropriately.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The back end will be a collection of object interfaces to hosting
subsystems.  The single most important object will be the SQL
interface.  Another object will talk to a Mailman instance. More
objects may be added as Savant capabilities improve.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The language interpreter will interpret incoming unfolded requests
passed to it by the front end, call the back end as needed to query or
change system state, and generate a response to be passed back to the
front end for folding and dispatch.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Unless someone makes an overwhelmingly convincing argument against
it, I intend to write the Savant daemon in Python. Here is the
rationale:</p></div>
<div class="olist"><ol>
<li>
<p>
As already noted, JSON and Python are well-matched, making the
folding and unfolding operations easier and increasing the
transparency of the system.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Standard Python library classes - email, json, and smtp in
particular - will supply much of the front-end plumbing. It may be
possible to use Twisted[http://twistedmatrix.com/] to avoid
hand-rolling most of the daemon framework.
