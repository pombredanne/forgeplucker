This placeholder
page describes an ancestor, bugplucker.py, which is demonstration code 
expected to evolve into forgeplucker.</p><p>bugplucker.py can extract the complete state of a project's bug
tracker from any supported hosting system.  Uses for this capability
including making emergency backups, working on buglists without
network access, and statistical analyses of project histories.</p><p>For a list of supported systems, use the <code class="option">-?</code>
option or <code class="option">-h</code> option.</p><p>The program requires one argument, a hosting-site name and
project name separated by a slash. It produces a dump of the
bugtracker state in JSON on output.</p><p>The program requires that you be a member of the project you
are pulling state for, with the authority to modify tracker entries.
This is not because the program modifies entries (it doesn't) but
because its parsing techniques rely heavily on the structure of HTML
select elements in order to make sense out of what would otherwise be
text soup.</p><p>The program also requires that you have your user preforences on
the site you are pulling from set to display messages in English and
display dates as local time for your timezone. Many hostiong sites do
not reliably display a timezone in dates, and timezone conversion is
intrinsically unreliable where it is supported. Thus, the code must
rely on
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">localtime</span>(3)</span>.</p><p>The program accepts the following options:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">-f</span></dt><dd><p>Specify the forge-system type. May not be necessary, as the
program can infer a type from well-known sitenames.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-u</span></dt><dd><p>Set your username for authentication purposes.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-p</span></dt><dd><p>Set your password for site-authentication purposes.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-i</span></dt><dd><p>Fetch an individual detail page and return the JSON for the
corresponding issue. The specification should be two colon-separated
parts, a tracker name and a bug ID. Mainly useful for debgging.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-r</span></dt><dd><p>Dump in XML rather than JSON.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-s</span></dt><dd><p>Sample mode. Get only the most recent bug in each
tracker. Useful for verifying that you can read a forge type
correctly without fetching an entire project.  Also useful if what
you want is just the atttribute ranges for project metadata.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-v</span></dt><dd><p>Set a numeric verbosity level, primarily for debugging. 1
enables various progress messages to standard error, and 2 enables
dumping of web pages as they are fetched.</p></dd></dl></div><p>These options are mainly for testing purposes; for production it
is recommended that you put your credentials in your .netrc file in
order to avoid having to type your password frequently where it might
be seen. The 'account' field, if present, will be interpreted as a
forge type overriding the normal heuristics.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><a id="bugs"></a><h2>BUGS</h2><p>The program will change the settings on yoor tracker search form
in order to collect all bugs.  You will probably have to reset them
afterwards.</p><p>It's not forgeplucker yet. Forgeplucker will capture the
project's <span class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> state, not just the trackers.</p><p>Bugplucker dumps are all in JSON, but the shape and keywords are
forge-type-specific. At a later stage of the project, once we have gained
field experience with many hosting sites, we expect to design a
uniform dump file format.</p><p>No tools yet exist to import the dumps into forge systems. They
cannot be written until we have a standardized format.</p><p>The range of supported systems could be larger, and will be.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><a id="see_also"></a><h2>SEE ALSO</h2><p>
